<h1>Steps to Puppy Proof A Home</h1>
<ol>  
	<li>Start before you have the puppy.:</li>
<p>Make sure that before you bring the little dog home, you have the house prepared for him or her.</p>
	<li>Check for sharp objects near the floor and cover them.:</li>
<p>Puppies are very small and delicate. However, they think they are bigger than they are and believe they are indestructable. Make sure that your home is safe for these brave little creatures to run and play in.</p> 
	<li>Pick up all small objects from the floor, including wires and shoes.:</li>
<p>All puppies are very curious, and they love to chew on anything they see. Protect things that you value from being destroyed and keep your puppy from choking on something small.</p>
	<li>Remove potted house plants and make sure there are no poisonous plants in your yard.:</li>
	<li>Fence off rooms that you do not want the dog in.:<li>
	<li>Put bathroom trash cans up high where your dog cannot get into them.:</li>
	<li>Keep doors closed and fence off stairwells.:</li>
	<li>Buy and designate chew toys for the puppy (see supplies page for some ideas).:</li>
	<li>Buy cleaning products, preparing for accidents.:</li>
	<li>Welcome home your puppy!:</li>
